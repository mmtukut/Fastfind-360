cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local (use any text editor)
nano .env.local

# Paste your Mapbox token:
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1... <-- your token here

# Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
```

### Step 3: Test It

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev

# Open your browser to: http://localhost:5173/
```
