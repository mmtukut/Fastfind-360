FastFind360 Logo Instructions
==============================

To add the FastFind360 logo:

1. Save the logo image as: /workspace/public/logo-white.png
2. The logo should be a white/light colored version for the blue header
3. Recommended size: 200-300px wide, transparent background
4. Format: PNG with transparency

The application is already configured to display the logo at:
- Header height: 48px (h-12)
- Auto width to maintain aspect ratio
- Located in the top-left corner of the header

The logo will replace the satellite emoji (üõ∞Ô∏è) currently shown.
