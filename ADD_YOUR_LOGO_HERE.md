# ðŸŽ¨ Add Your FastFind360 Logo

## Quick Instructions

I've set up the application to display your FastFind360 logo in the header!

### Option 1: Add Your PNG Logo (Recommended)
Simply copy your `logo-white.png` file to:
```bash
/workspace/public/logo-white.png
```

The app will automatically detect and use it!

### Option 2: Use the SVG Placeholder (Current)
A temporary SVG logo is currently displayed at:
```bash
/workspace/public/logo-white.svg
```

You can replace this with your own SVG logo if preferred.

## Logo Requirements

âœ… **Background**: Transparent  
âœ… **Colors**: White or light colors (displays on blue gradient)  
âœ… **Size**: ~250px wide Ã— 60px tall (or similar ratio)  
âœ… **Format**: PNG or SVG  
âœ… **File size**: Under 100KB  

## Current Setup

The logo is already integrated and will:
- âœ… Display in the header (56px height)
- âœ… Show next to "12,847 Buildings Detected"
- âœ… Auto-scale to maintain aspect ratio
- âœ… Include error fallback handling
- âœ… Work in both dev and production builds

## To See Your Logo

1. Add your logo file to `/workspace/public/`
2. Refresh the browser (the dev server auto-reloads)
3. Your logo will appear in the header!

**Current Status**: âœ… Temporary SVG logo is displayed  
**Next Step**: Replace with your official logo file
