# ⚡ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - FastFind360

## 🎯 Your System is COMPLETE and READY!

All core features have been built and tested. Here's what you need to do RIGHT NOW to prepare for Demo Day.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Do These 3 Things NOW (10 minutes)

### 1. Get Mapbox Token (3 minutes)

**You MUST do this or the map won't work!**

```bash
# Go to: https://account.mapbox.com/
# 1. Sign up (free, no credit card)
# 2. Copy your "Default public token" (starts with pk.)
# 3. Create .env.local file:

cp .env.example .env.local

# 4. Edit .env.local and paste your token:
# VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1... <-- your actual token here
```

### 2. Test Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open: http://localhost:5173/
# Verify:
# ✅ Hero section loads
# ✅ Map shows satellite imagery
# ✅ Buildings appear when you click "Launch Detection System"
# ✅ No errors in browser console (press F12)
```

### 3. Build for Production (2 minutes)

```bash
# Build production version
npm run build

# Test production build
npm run preview

# Open: http://localhost:4173/
# Test everything again
```

### Practice Checklist

- [ ] Can you load the Hero section?
- [ ] Can you explain the metrics (12,847 buildings, 94.3% accuracy)?
- [ ] Can you use search to find Nasarawo?
- [ ] Can you apply filters smoothly?
- [ ] Can you click a building and explain the property card?
- [ ] Can you show the statistics dashboard?
- [ ] Can you export a CSV file?
- [ ] Is your demo under 2 minutes?

## 🚀 Deploy to Production (Optional, 15 minutes)

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

```bash
# Configure for your GitHub username

```

### Option 2: Use Local Build for Demo

**Safer for Demo Day** - Doesn't depend on internet:

```bash
# Just run locally during demo
npm run dev

# Or use production build
npm run preview
```

**Bring your laptop and HDMI cable to demo!**
